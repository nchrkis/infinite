# README: OpenAI Framework Comparison

## Overview
This repository contains information regarding evaluation of the performance of three OpenAI frameworks: **ChatGPT-4o, OpenAI-o1 pro, and OpenAI-o3 mini-high**. The primary objective of this study is to assess their ability to generate an LSTM-based deep learning model for time series prediction of meteorological parameters.

## Purpose and Scope
The three frameworks were independently tasked with generating Python code for an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, using a **pre-defined set of requirements**. Each model was expected to:
- Read time series data from a CSV file.
- Process and prepare the data for deep learning.
- Train and validate an LSTM network.
- Predict three key meteorological parameters:
  - **Temperature (Â°C)**
  - **Relative Humidity (%)**
  - **Wind Speed (m/s)**
- Produce graphs comparing predictions with ground truth.

By comparing the final working implementations from each framework, we aim to evaluate their capabilities in:
1. Code accuracy and correctness.
2. Computational efficiency.
3. Consistency in model output.
4. Adherence to the predefined instructions.

## Repository Contents
This repository includes a zipped file, which contains:
- **Time Series Data:** The CSV file containing the meteorological dataset used for training and validation.
- **Generated LSTM Codes:** The complete working code implementations produced by ChatGPT-4o, OpenAI-o1 pro, and OpenAI-o3 mini-high.
- **Generated Graphs** The comparison graphs between predicitons and ground truth, as were generated by each model.

## Usage Instructions
1. Load the provided CSV dataset into the respective generated LSTM model codes.
2. Run each script independently to train and evaluate the LSTM models.
3. Compare the predictions for temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed.

## Conclusion
This study provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different OpenAI frameworks when tasked with generating deep learning models for time series forecasting. The results can help in selecting the most suitable AI-assisted approach for similar applications in meteorology and beyond.
