# INFINITE: Comparing AI-Generated Codes

## Overview
This repository evaluates the performance of three OpenAI frameworks: **ChatGPT-4o**, **OpenAI-o1 Pro**, and **OpenAI-o3 Mini-High**. The goal is to assess their abilities in generating Python code for two tasks:
1. **A Simple Data Cleaning Task**: Python code to clean a CSV file containing `NaN` values and compute statistical measures.
2. **A Complex LSTM Task**: Python code for building an LSTM-based deep learning model for time series forecasting.

By comparing the generated implementations, this study provides insights into the frameworks’ strengths in:
- Code generation accuracy and correctness
- Computational efficiency
- Consistency in outputs
- Adherence to predefined instructions

## Purpose and Scope

### Simple Task: Data Cleaning
Each framework was tasked with generating Python code to:
1. Read a CSV file containing random `NaN` values.
2. Remove rows with `NaN` values.
3. Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation of each row.
4. Output the statistics into a text file.
5. Save the cleaned dataset in a new CSV file.

### Complex Task: LSTM Model Generation
Each framework was also tasked with generating Python code for an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network to:
- Read time series data from a CSV file.
- Preprocess the data for deep learning.
- Train and validate an LSTM model.
- Forecast three meteorological parameters:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Relative Humidity (%)
  - Wind Speed (m/s)
- Generate comparison graphs of predictions and ground truth.

The outputs were evaluated for performance and compliance with requirements.
